  "description": "I’d been stanning the hero for 3 years when I was suddenly caught red-handed by his tyrannical doting father, Duke Hades Louvremont.\n\n“Ceaseless pursuit, expensive gifts, and now you’ve come alone all this way up north with no regard for your life…”\n“I’m sorry. I have no excuse.”\n“Alright, I’ve lost. Your devotion is undeniable.”\n“…You think so too? Even I admit that this is the pinnacle of devotion.”\n“Many women have pursued me, but none as persistently as you. I stand amazed. Let’s hold it, then. Our wedding. As soon as possible.\"\n“Ha… Yes, I’ll accept my fate.”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Wait, pardon?! What?”\n\nWhat did he just say?\nSurely I must've misheard?\nBut the duke, smirking at my shocked face, gave the finishing blow.\n“I said, I’ll marry you.”\n\nWow.\nThe hero’s dad has an inflated ego.",
